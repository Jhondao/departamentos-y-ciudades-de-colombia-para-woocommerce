= Updating =


Automatic updates should work like a charm; as is the best practice, back up should be undertaken before updates.

If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the shop/category pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
